      "context": "I'm working on a speculative fiction novel and have shared the first five chapters with a writing group. Feedback has been mixed - some readers love the unique premise and worldbuilding but find the pacing slow, while others think the characters need more development. I've already invested a year in this project and believe in its potential, but I'm questioning whether to continue, start a major revision, or shelve it for a new project.",

      "context": "I've written a screenplay for an experimental film that blends documentary and narrative techniques. Traditional production companies have passed on it, saying it's too niche and commercially risky. I could self-fund on a minimal budget, but this would require significant personal financial investment. Industry peers are divided - some think it could be a breakthrough, others think the concept is too abstract for audiences.",

My previous work was moderately successful, but I feel creatively drawn to explore a very different sound and theme that diverges significantly from what my audience expects. Early demos shared with my label received hesitant responses, suggesting I might lose my current audience. However, these new songs feel more authentic and meaningful to me as an artist.",

I've developed a radically different concept for their new product that I believe could significantly differentiate them in the market, but it contradicts their established design language. My team is divided on whether to present this concept or create something more aligned with their expectations. The client has mentioned wanting 'fresh ideas' but has rejected bold concepts in the past.",

Early prototype testing showed players were initially confused by the unconventional gameplay, though some became enthusiastic once they understood it. Development has taken longer than expected, and I'm concerned about market reception. I could simplify the concept to make it more accessible or stay true to the original vision despite the risks.",
